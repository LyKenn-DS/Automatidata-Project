# Automatidata-Project
Regression Analysis to simplify complex data relationships and predict taxi fare amounts.

## Scenario
Automatidata works with its clients to transform their unused and stored data into useful solutions, such as performance dashboards, customer-facing tools, strategic business insights, and more. They specialize in identifying a client’s business needs and utilizing their data to meet those business needs.

Automatidata is consulting for the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). New York City TLC is an agency responsible for licensing and regulating New York City's taxi cabs and for-hire vehicles. The agency has partnered with Automatidata to develop a regression model that helps estimate taxi fares before the ride, based on data that TLC has gathered. The TLC data comes from over 200,000 taxi and limousine licensees, making approximately one million combined trips per day. 

## Problem Statement
Having completed an initial plan of action, initial Python coding work, EDA, and A/B testing, the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (New York City TLC) wants the Automatidata team to build a multiple linear regression model to predict taxi fares using existing data that was collected over a year. 

The specific tasks needed at this stage of the project include:
  • Determine the correct modeling approach
  • Build a regression model
  • Finish checking model assumptions
  • Evaluate the mode
  • Interpret model results and summarize findings for stakeholders within TLC

These will help the data practitioner practice planning out, demonstrating knowledge of EDA, and building a multiple linear regression model based on a specific business need.
